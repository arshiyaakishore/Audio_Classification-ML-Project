# Audio_Classification-ML-Project

Problem Statement:

The primary challenge is to build an accurate model that, when given an audio file as input, should determine whether the audio features correctly contain one of the target labels.

Dataset Used: UrbanSound8K

Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is called the Urban Sound 8k dataset. The dataset contains 8732 audio files(in .wav format) of 10 different classes and is listed below. Each audio file is anywhere between 3.75 seconds to 4 seconds long. When downloading the data, the data is pre-sorted into ten folds (labelled fold1, fold2, â€¦, fold10) to support a 10-fold cross-validation. Our task is to extract different features from these files and classify the corresponding audio files into categories.
1.	Air Conditioner
2.	Car Horn
3.	Children Playing
4.	Dog Bark
5.	Drilling Machine
6.	Engine Idling
7.	Gun Shot
8.	Jackhammer
9.	Siren
10.	Street Music
